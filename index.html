          <h1>Hi, I'm Kiran!</h1>
          <p> I am currently a 3rd year mathematical and computer engineering student at Queen's University.
              I have done two summer internships, one at American Sugar Refineries, Redpath Sugar in the Summer of 2019, and  
              another one with Wamri.ai in the summer of 2020.
            </p>

          <p>I am currently looking to work as an intern in the summer of 2021 and in the future work as a software developer
             after graduating.
          </p>

          <p>My hopes are to create efficient code and to be able to utilize my knowledge in both mathematics and
            programming to generate great algorithms. I enjoy the crossover of these two topics, which is why I
            have decided to pursue them in higher education.
          </p>

          <p>My hobbies include swimming, reading and baking/cooking!</p>

          <p> Please don't hesitate to reach out to me and connect on LinkedIn at:
